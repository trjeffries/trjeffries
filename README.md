# Hi there ðŸ‘‹
## About me

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™ve recently started as a Data Consultant at The Information Lab in London, and after doing plenty of training with Tableau, Alteryx, Power BI, etc., am learning SQL and Python. Not sure how much I'll be using them throughout my career, but it's good to have skills, right?
- âš¡ Fun fact: I'm fairy sure I learned a fair bit of Python back at university, but it turns out you can forget quite a lot in 15 years, who'd have thought it?
